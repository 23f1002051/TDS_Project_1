- Data was scraped from the GitHub API by filtering users in Toronto with over 100 followers and fetching their most recent repositories.
- The most surprising insight is that longer bios significantly correlate with more followers, showing that a well-crafted bio can notably boost a user's followingâ€”even more so than creating additional repositories.
- Developers aiming to grow their following should prioritize crafting a comprehensive bio and actively using features like projects and wikis, as these elements contribute more to visibility and engagement than the number of repositories alone.
