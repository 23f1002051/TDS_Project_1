- Data was scraped from the GitHub API by filtering users in Toronto with over 100 followers and fetching their most recent repositories.
- The most surprising insight is that longer bios significantly correlate with more followers, showing that a well-crafted bio can notably boost a user's followingâ€”even more so than creating additional repositories.
- To attract more followers, developers should invest in a detailed, engaging bio and focus on quality over quantity in repositories, as these factors more effectively boost influence than simply increasing repo count.
